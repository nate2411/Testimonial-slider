            using computers to generate the paragraphs, but they weren't very
            good and many times didn't make any sense at all. We therefore took
            the time to create paragraphs specifically for this generator to
            make it the best that we could.</q

            Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to
            get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The
            writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about
            when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to
            complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use
            the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A
            second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short
            story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph
            be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these
            challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to
            incorporate the paragraph into their writing.</q

          <q>
            A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to
            tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being
            stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete.
            By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it
            can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the
            writers' block in the first place.</q

            widely. Most paragraphs focus on a single idea that's expressed with
            an introductory sentence, then followed by two or more supporting
            sentences about the idea. A short paragraph may not reach even 50
            words while long paragraphs can be over 400 words long, but
            generally speaking they tend to be approximately 200 words in
